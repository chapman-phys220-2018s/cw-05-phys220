# PHYS220 CW 5

**Author(s):** **Daniel, Devon, Myranda**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2018s/cw-05-phys220.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2018s/cw-05-phys220)

## Specification

1. With your partner, go through and complete the notebook `cw05.ipynb`. This notebook will demonstrate the implementation of useful functions, and how to plot them using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
1. With any extra time, create a new notebook `plots.ipynb` and implement a few of the more interesting exercises from the following `matplotlib` tutorial for practice : https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

I liked this assignment alot because it helped familiarize with plotting graphs using different methods. Hardest part was the 3D plot but I feel pretty comfortable now. (Daniel)

This assignment allowed me to practice the various plotting methods. (MH)
